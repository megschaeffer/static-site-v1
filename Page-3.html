        One of the first things that people know about me is that I have a twin brother. Whenever I am introducing
        myself to a new group of people, especially new classes, that is always the "fun fact" that I use as an ice breaker.
        Mat and I both attend the University of Minnesota, and both mistakenly began our college careers in the
        College of Biological Sciences! Now, he is in the Carlson School and I am in CLA. I love having him so close
        to me since we get along well and lean on each other often for support.

        Below is a picture of us in high school both working at Cold Stone Creamery. He didn't actually work there, but
        my boss let him work one shift with me just for fun!

        My mom recently got a job as a receptionist working for Abbott Laboratories, and my dad is a software developer/ data analyst
        currently working as a consultant for Digi-Key electronics/eXcellentia. He's definitely a good resource to help me
        develop my digital literacy skills.
