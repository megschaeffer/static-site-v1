    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I grew up in Rogers, Minnesota right across the street from both my middle school and high school. 
        Throughout my childhood I tried playing soccer and tennis, but ended up choosing gymnastics as my 
        lifelong sport until I graduated high school.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was a gymnast for 16 years of my life, and it has played a big role in shaping me into the person I am today.
        Gymnastics taught me what it meant to be on a team and to have goals outside of your own life. I developed
        leadership as a gymnast and learned how to push myself to my limits.

        Below is a picture of me doing a dismount on my favorite event: uneven bars.

            <h2>My diving career</h2>
    <p>        
        Once I was a sophomore in high school, I added springboard diving to that list of sports. It terrified me,
        but it gave me confidence and lessons that I will keep with me for the rest of my life. I have never been a strong swimmer,
        so if you would've told me I would ever be a diver, I would have laughed in your face.
    </p>
    <p>
        I surprised myself with how quickly I picked up on the skills for diving, which is definitely thanks to my gymnastics
        background. By the time I was a senior in high school, I was good enough to place 8th at the sections meet which earned
        me a spot on the podium!

        Here is a picture of me competing at a meet in Cambridge, MN in 2017.
