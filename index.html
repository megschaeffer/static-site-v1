             My first attempt at HTML
         </h2>
         <p>
             Hello! My name is Meghan, and I am a junior studying Technical Writing and Communication at the University of Minnesota.
             This is the first time I have ever dealt with HTML and it makes me feel really good about myself.
             I think things are going fairly well so far, but I am excited to get to know more as I keep using it!
         </p>

             Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-schaeffer-5bbb64202/">LinkedIn profile</a>
             to give you more information about my professional and educational history.

             Below is an image of my friends and I at a Gopher football game nearly two years ago now!
             I definitely miss going to fun events like this before COVID-19.
